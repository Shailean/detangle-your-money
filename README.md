# About the project
In 2017, a friend and I created a financial literacy project called "Detangle Your Money" in an attempt to teach financial literacy workshops and provide individual financial coaching to populations who are often ignored by mainstream financial services. 

At the time, working as a Financial Coach with no programming skills, I created a very basic website using Wix but I was never happy with it and even years after the project ended it still bothered me that I didn't have the skills to showcase the website I had envisioned.

Now that I have acquired some programming skills through self study and bootcamps I decided to create the website I would've created in 2017 had I known what I was doing (lol)

## Tools Used
1. **Figma**: I have an interest in UI and content design so I challenged myself to learn Figma by creating the wireframe for this website 
2. **HTML** 
3. **CSS**

## Challenges
- I am currently working on making the website responsive to mobile screens
- I need to research the difference between untis of measurment in CSS (pixels, em, percentages) because I often had problems with getting images and buttons to be in the right position on screen
